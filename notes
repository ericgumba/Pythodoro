Todo: 


1. Use a dictionary to track how many tasks are in each entry

    a = { date: [ activity1, activity2, ..., activityN ] }

        import pickle
        d = { "abc" : [1, 2, 3], "qwerty" : [4,5,6] }
        afile = open(r'C:\d.pkl', 'wb')
        pickle.dump(d, afile)
        afile.close()

        #reload object from file
        file2 = open(r'C:\d.pkl', 'rb')
        new_d = pickle.load(file2)
        file2.close()

        #print dictionary object loaded from file
        print new_d

2. Implement a seperate thread for skipping, pausing and continuing program. (PRIORITY)
